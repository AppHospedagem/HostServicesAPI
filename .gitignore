appsettings.Development.json # Generally ignore local dev settings if they contain sensitive info
appsettings.Production.json # IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit production settings with secrets!
# Be careful with appsettings.*.json files. You might want to include some but exclude others.
# A common practice is to only include appsettings.json and let specific environments override with env vars.
